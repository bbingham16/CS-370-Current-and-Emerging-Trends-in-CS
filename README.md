# CS-370-Current-and-Emerging-Trends-in-CS

This class focused on learning about AI and the learning algorithms that are available to accomplish various goals. Throughout the work in this class, we used different algorithms to learn how to train AI successfully. In the last project I successfully built the deep Q-Training algorithm that allowed a pirate, or AI, to successfully learn the map with obstacles and find the treasure. 

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists are paving the way for the future in more ways than one. I personally come from a medical background of being a nurse for the past 12 years. I never thought about computer science creating a path for medical advancements. But here we are! We have computer scientists creating AI that uses deep learning pathways to assist neuroscientists in studying the proteins found on Earth and the human body. Such discoveries have made it possible to make medical advancements in pharmacology, as well as cancer research that would have otherwise taken years and millions of dollars to accomplish.


How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
Approaching a problem as a computer scientist really involves a lot of background information. Why are we creating this AI, and what are our goals? This really helps us determine which learning algorithm would suit this AI best to be successful. 


What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
As always ethical concerns are a major part of every software developerâ€™s career. There is a right way of doing things and a wrong way and we must find that fine line and make sure we are making the right choice for the side of the line we choose to work with. Working with AI is no different. AI has the ability, in most cases, to learn faster and perform better than any other human. That is amazing, but also worrisome of what the future may look like for this AI.
